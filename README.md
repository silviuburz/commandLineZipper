# commandLineZipper

A simple command line program I wrote to zip a directory for a batch file. Probably other ways to do this, 
but it took me like 30 seconds to create. To run, cd to the directory above the folder you want to zip
then call zipper mydir and it will output mydir.zip in the current directory
